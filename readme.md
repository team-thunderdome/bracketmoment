# About

Typerror is a simple Python coding-themed type racer.

Just type what you see on screen... except for when it's not correct!

Sometimes what you see might be wrong. It's up to you to spot any errors in the line of code and fix them. Gain score every time you correctly type a line of code. If you can't figure it out, skip to get a new prompt.
